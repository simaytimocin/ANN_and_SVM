Artificial neural networks are inspired by the nervous system of human biology. The lines that provide the connections are synapses. From the moment people are born, they observe their environment, learn and act accordingly, synaptic bonds emerge as they gain experience. Artificial neural networks are similar. Neural networks also learn by training. 


There may be more than one input layer, but there is only one output layer. It is mostly used in models that require intensive calculations. In this project, a simple model was created with simple data.


# Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Support Vector Machine is a supervised learning method. It has associated learning algorithms that analyze data used for classification and regression analysis. SVM is classification and separation of points in a plane by a line or hyperplane. It is suitable for small or medium datasets.
